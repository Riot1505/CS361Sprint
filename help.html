                <p>Welcome to the help page! <br> <br>
                    Here are a few steps to help with using the app. <br>
                    The home page will show the block format of your goals. You can add goals in this page by <br>
                    selecting the "Add Goal" button. That will give a small display, requiring the goal's name,
                    description, priority, and reminder time, and deadline.<br>
                    The priority section will visually show the Goals listed in terms of their priority.<br>
                    The Reminder section will show each Goal. The calendar section will show the deadline of your goal.<br>
                    Undo: The undo button will undo the last action that was made. If you deleted a goal, you can undo it within<br>
                    the first session.
                    Redo: The redo button will revert an undo.
                    Note: The add goal webpage includes several required inputs. It may take time to fulfill each input.
